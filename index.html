But also, not? It&rsquo;s a psychological construct (not to be confused with the sociological kind).</p><p>Our brains make it up when we see red and blue light together, but it also processes the fact that green light is missing. It doesn&rsquo;t exist in the hue spectrum.</p><h2>What do you mean it&rsquo;s a construct? <br>I see it literally everywhere!</h2><p>Yeah, but human brains are just guessing what the color is. We can&rsquo;t comprehend what light is being bounced back to our eyes when we see flowers n&rsquo; stuff, unlike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whks0aPBhDw" title="just... enjoy the chaos">birds</a>—they sure do like it.</p><h2>OK, then explain <abbr title="Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key (Black)" tabindex="0">CMYK</abbr>.</h2><p><span style="color:#0ff">C</span>M<span style="color:#ff0">Y</span> is the opposite of <span style="color:#f00">R</span><span style="color:#0f0">G</span><span style="color:#00f">B</span>.</p><p>CMYK is a <dfn title="white is the absence of color and all colors together make black" tabindex="0">subtractive</dfn> color model, while RGB is <dfn title="black is the absence of color and all colors together make white" tabindex="0">additive</dfn>.</p><p>Magenta is the opposite of green because the absence of green light leaves red and blue light.</p><p>The K stands for “Key,” which is the stand-in for CMY mixed together because can you imagine all that ink you would waste if your printer had to make black every single time?
